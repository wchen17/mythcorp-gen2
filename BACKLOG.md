# BACKLOG

Pre-formatted issues for the next session (mobile or desktop, you or a fresh agent). Each item is independent. Pick any.

To post all of these to GitHub Issues at once, run:

```powershell
gh auth login         # one time, opens a browser
./tools/post-backlog-to-issues.ps1
```

That script reads every `## #N, ...` heading in this file and creates one Issue per heading on `wchen17/mythcorp-gen2`, applying the labels in the `**Labels:**` line.

---

## #2, /wc/about page (currently 404)

**Labels:** `content`, `next-up`

**Body:**

`/wc` has a card linking to `/wc/about` but the route doesn't exist. Either:
1. Build a real `/wc/about` page with a short bio + project history timeline.
2. Or remove the card from `src/app/wc/page.tsx`'s `sections` array.

Recommendation: build the page. Pattern after `/wc/papers` shape (eyebrow + heading + sections). Content: Will Chen (Weibao Chen), undergrad working on AI safety / cybersecurity adjacent stuff, why this site exists (sandbox + showcase), what's coming next.

---

## #3, Walkthrough: `/wc/learn/landing-flow`

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `next-up`

**Body:**

Second annotated walkthrough at `src/app/wc/learn/landing-flow/page.tsx`. Subject: how the cinematic boot works.

Cover:
- `LoadingScreen` (cyberpunk binary digit shape) at `src/app/components/LoadingScreen.tsx`.
- `LandingPage` (3D MYTHCORP logo + spectre model) at `src/app/components/LandingPage.tsx`.
- `NewLandingPage` (luxury Chicago skyline reveal) at `src/app/components/NewLandingPage.tsx`.
- The handoff: `useGLTF.preload('/spectre.glb')` at module top, plus mutually-exclusive Canvas mounting in `AppLoader` (only one `<Canvas>` alive at a time, otherwise R3F crashes under StrictMode).
- The session-storage skip: boot only runs on first visit per session.

Use the `Walkthrough`/`Section`/`Code`/`Aside` helpers from `src/app/wc/learn/_components/Walkthrough.tsx`. Add `landing-flow` to `WALKTHROUGHS` in `src/app/wc/learn/page.tsx` and flip its `status` from `soon` to `ready`.

---

## #4, Walkthrough: `/wc/learn/3d-scene`

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `next-up`

**Body:**

Third walkthrough at `src/app/wc/learn/3d-scene/page.tsx`. Subject: anatomy of `src/app/experience/Simulation.tsx`.

Cover:
- `<Canvas>` + R3F basics
- `ParticleField`: `BufferGeometry` + `Float32Array` for vertex positions and colors
- `Stars` count clamped at `MAX_STARS = 12000` with `STARS_PER_UNIT = 1200` (and *why*: original `5000 * settings.stars` could hit 25k particles)
- `Bloom` post-processing tuning (`luminanceThreshold`, `mipmapBlur`)
- The randomisable `DEFAULTS` settings object and `getRandomSettings()`

---

## #5, More figures for `/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime`

**Labels:** `paper`, `feature`

**Body:**

Two figures shipped (`<BarrierToEntry />`, `<CapabilityRamp />`). The paper has 4-6 more passages that map cleanly to interactive widgets:

- **Expert Debate quadrant**: 2x2 grid (LeCun / Altman / Whittaker / Hinton) with offensive vs defensive impact bars per quadrant. From Tables 6 and 7. Click to focus a quadrant and see argument detail.
- **Attack chain step-through**: a Stuxnet or Hong Kong CFO heist case study as a horizontal step diagram, with each step labeled "still requires human" / "AI does this now" / "AI will do this".
- **Governance trilemma triangle**: open-source vs regulation vs antitrust as a triangle with a draggable point that shows which threat surface each policy blend leaves open.
- **Stage-1-to-4 capability ladder**: vertical infographic of the technical hurdles (planning, error handling, memory, self-improvement, vulnerability discovery, cross-domain synthesis) as a ladder with current/projected positions marked.

Each new figure goes in `src/app/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime/_components/` and gets a `<Section>` in the main page. Keep the projection-vs-evidence visual distinction the reviewer asked for.

---

## #7, Wire MDX for `/wc/papers`

**Labels:** `paper`, `infra`

**Body:**

The first paper (`/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime`) is a TSX page right now. That's fine for figure-heavy pages with custom React widgets, but adding MDX support would make future papers easier to author (write `.mdx`, embed React components inline).

Steps:
- `npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/react remark-gfm rehype-pretty-code shiki`
- Update `next.config.ts` with `pageExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']` and the `withMDX` wrapper.
- Create `src/app/wc/papers/mdx-components.tsx` exporting `<Figure>`, `<Aside>`, `<Sandbox>` so embedded React/3D demos are easy.
- Verify it builds on Cloudflare Workers (`npm run preview`) before merging. Past us has been bitten by Node-only MDX plugins on the edge runtime.

---

## #8, Migrate `/animals` and remaining `/og/*` to themed surfaces

**Labels:** `polish`, `housekeeping`

**Body:**

Theme Tier 2 utilities (`themed-surface`, `themed-button`, `themed-pill`) now exist but `/animals`, `/og/chat`, and `/og/interactive` haven't been migrated. They still use hand-rolled `border border-[color:var(--border)] bg-[color:var(--bg-elevated)]` patterns.

Replace those with the utility classes so all themes get their proper design language (paper gets the hard-offset shadow, luxury gets glass blur, etc.).

---

## #9, Mobile QA pass

**Labels:** `polish`, `accessibility`

**Body:**

The site has been built with `sm:` breakpoints from day one, but never actually verified on a real phone. Open the deployed branch on iOS Safari and Chrome Android and check:

- Boot flow doesn't break (LoadingScreen + LandingPage 3D)
- Hamburger menu opens cleanly with one finger
- Theme switcher reachable
- `/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime` figures (BarrierToEntry, CapabilityRamp) work with touch
- Hero "DISCOVER YOUR POTENTIAL" doesn't wrap weirdly
- /experience MainMenu CTA is thumb-reachable
- /fmhy iframe behaves on mobile (likely doesn't render at all)

Document issues in a follow-up comment, fix in a follow-up PR.

---

## #10, 3D experience mobile fallback

**Labels:** `feature`, `performance`

**Body:**

`/experience` and `/` both render heavy R3F scenes that target desktop GPUs. On a low-end Android, the fan spins up immediately. Add a check (UA sniff or `navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4`) and either:

1. Render a static screenshot of the scene with a "your device might not love this; tap to render anyway" overlay, or
2. Drop particle counts and disable `<Bloom>` postprocessing on mobile.

The MainMenu tease bar (`~12k particles`) becomes a knob, not just decoration.

---

## #11, Accessibility pass

**Labels:** `accessibility`, `polish`

**Body:**

`prefers-reduced-motion` is already honored for the theme transition curtain. Extend to:
- LoadingScreen 3D animation (skip the binary digit fly-in if reduce)
- LandingPage 3D logo (static pose if reduce)
- HelpDot panel entrance
- Konami egg confetti
- AnimatedHeading shadows
- Banner pulse glow

Also: keyboard navigation through the SiteHeader menu, focus rings everywhere, ARIA labels on the BarrierToEntry toggle and CapabilityRamp slider, alt text for the skyline image.

---

## #12, Subset `Inter_Bold.json`

**Labels:** `polish`, `performance`

**Body:**

`public/fonts/Inter_Bold.json` is 5.2MB but `<Text3D>` only renders the word "MYTHCORP" (8 unique characters). Use `facetype.js` to subset:

```bash
npx facetype.js Inter-Bold.ttf --chars MYTHCORP > public/fonts/Inter_Bold.json
```

Should drop ~5MB off the initial boot. Only `src/app/components/LandingPage.tsx` uses it.

---

## #13, Camera FOV polish: GSAP transition between routes

**Labels:** `polish`, `3d`

**Body:**

LandingPage and Simulation now both use `fov={55}` so there's no zoom snap, but the route change is still a hard cut. A GSAP-tween across the transition (fade out + slight zoom in + fade in new scene) would feel more cinematic.

Probably best wrapped in a `<RouteTransition>` HOC that uses Next.js's `useRouter` events.

---

## #14, Pioneer Scholars paper continuation

**Labels:** `paper`, `content`

**Body:**

`/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime` shipped sections 1, 2, "why this matters", "reviewer feedback", "where this goes next". The original paper has more chapters worth converting:

- **Pre-AI baseline** (Section 3): Table 1 details + nation-state resource framing
- **Present threat landscape** (Section 5): malware case studies (GoldFactory trojan, etc.) as small inline diagrams
- **Future horizon 2025-2030** (Section 6): per-stage hard requirements as a checklist visualization
- **Expert debate** (Section 7): tied to BACKLOG #5 expert-quadrant figure
- **Countermeasures** (Section 8): governance trilemma figure (also #5)
- **Conclusion**: short call-to-action paragraph

Each lands as a new `<Section>` in `src/app/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime/page.tsx`. Tighten the prose vs the original PDF.

---

## #15, Time-of-day auto theme

**Labels:** `feature`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

Add an "auto" theme option that picks based on local time:
- 06:00-11:00: `paper` (morning reading)
- 11:00-19:00: `luxury` (afternoon warmth)
- 19:00-06:00: `cyberpunk` (night)

Stored as `mythcorp-theme=auto` in localStorage. The ThemeSwitcher gets a fourth option "auto" with a sun/moon glyph that flips based on time.

---

## #16, View Transitions API for route changes

**Labels:** `feature`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

Next.js 15 has experimental View Transitions support. Enable it for cross-fade between routes (e.g. `/` to `/wc` or `/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime`). Combined with `view-transition-name` on the SiteHeader logo, the logo would morph instead of re-rendering.

Reference: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/viewTransition

---

## #17, RSS / Atom feed for `/wc/papers`

**Labels:** `feature`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

Add `/wc/papers/feed.xml` (or `.atom`) so people can subscribe. Static generation: read the `PAPERS` array, emit the feed at build time. Once MDX is wired (BACKLOG #7), each paper has a date + title + summary that maps cleanly to feed entries.

---

## #18, Real WebSocket chat (promote `/og/chat`)

**Labels:** `feature`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

`/og/chat` is a local-only chat sandbox. Wire a Cloudflare Durable Object (or Workers KV) backend so messages persist + sync across users. Then promote out of `/og`:

1. Move `src/app/og/chat` to `src/app/chat`.
2. Drop `<DraftBanner />` and the local-only label.
3. Update MAP.md routes table.
4. Remove from `SKETCHES` in `src/app/og/page.tsx`.

---

## #19, Visitor guestbook on `/wc/about`

**Labels:** `feature`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

After #2 (build the about page), add a tiny KV-backed comment/guestbook box at the bottom. Cloudflare Workers KV is free at small scale. Moderation: simple word filter + manual review.

---

## #20, Custom domain

**Labels:** `infra`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

The site is currently on a `workers.dev` subdomain. Buy a custom domain (mythcorp.dev? mythcorp.app? wc.dev if available?) and point it at the Cloudflare Workers deployment. Configure in Cloudflare dashboard.

Bonus: set up `wc.<domain>` as an alias to `/wc/*` so the personal section has its own "subdomain" feel.

---

## #21, Cloudflare branch preview deploys

**Labels:** `infra`

**Body:**

Right now Cloudflare deploys only when `npm run deploy` is run manually. Configure Cloudflare Workers preview branch deploys so each PR gets its own URL. This makes mobile QA (BACKLOG #9) trivial: open the preview URL on a phone.

---

## #22, Cool-stuff sticky-note (low priority, future)

**Labels:** `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

Speculative ideas worth keeping around:

- **Reading log**: a `/wc/reads` page listing books / papers the author has been through, with a one-line take on each.
- **Page-level search** with Pagefind (works on static export, no backend).
- **Now-page** (à la sive.rs/now): what the author is currently working on, updated monthly.
- **3D scene presets** picker on /experience MainMenu (default / aurora / minimal / chaos).
- **Boot screen variety**: more loading shapes (helix, tunnel, particle storm) + per-theme variants (paper boot uses ink particles instead of cyan binary).
- **Spotify or Last.fm "now playing"** widget if the author has either.
- **GitHub contributions chart** auto-pulled to /wc/about.

---

## #23, Chomik: Digital Pet Hamster (standalone project or site feature)

**Labels:** `feature`, `fun`, `new-project`

**Body:**

A digital hamster (guinea pig? hamster? both?) that lives on the page and eats UI elements. Inspired by Desktop Goose, Shimeji, and the classic "neko" cat cursor chaser.

**Core concept:**
- A small animated sprite (pixel art or SVG) that roams around the viewport
- "Eats" UI elements it collides with: buttons, icons, nav items shrink/crumble/get chomped
- Gets fatter/happier as it eats more
- Poops little pellets after eating
- Falls asleep if idle, wakes up when the user interacts
- Has a small hunger meter; if not fed (no clicks/interaction) it starts nibbling on its own

**Scope options:**
1. **Site-wide overlay on mythcorp** -- toggled from a button in the footer or via easter egg (type "chomik"). Lives as a `<PetOverlay />` component that floats above all content with `pointer-events: none` except on the pet itself.
2. **Standalone GitHub repo** (`wchen17/chomik`) -- a tiny JS library anyone can drop onto a page. `<script src="chomik.js"></script>` and it just works. Has its own GitHub Pages demo site.
3. **Both** -- build standalone first, then embed it on mythcorp as a dependency.

**Technical approach (standalone):**
- Single `<canvas>` overlay, fixed position, full viewport
- Sprite sheet animation (walk, eat, sleep, poop, idle)
- Simple physics: gravity, ground = bottom of viewport, can climb on DOM elements
- DOM collision detection via `document.elementsFromPoint()` to find "edible" elements
- When eating: shrinks the target element with a CSS transition, plays chomp animation
- State machine: idle -> walking -> found-food -> eating -> satisfied -> walking -> sleepy -> sleeping
- Configurable: speed, appetite, which selectors are "edible", sprite theme

**For the GitHub Pages demo:**
- Landing page showing Chomik in action on a fake UI
- "Add to your site" instructions
- Configuration playground

---

## #24, Fake Terminal Overlay (press `/` anywhere)

**Labels:** `feature`, `easter-egg`

**Body:**

Press `/` anywhere on the site to open a translucent terminal overlay. It looks real but is purely cosmetic/fun -- no actual shell access.

**Behavior:**
- Slides down from top (or fades in) as a full-width panel, ~60% viewport height
- Monospace font, green-on-black or theme-appropriate (paper theme gets sepia terminal)
- Shows a fake prompt: `visitor@mythcorp ~ $`
- User can type anything. Responses are canned/funny:
  - `ls` -> lists the site routes
  - `cd /experience` -> actually navigates there
  - `whoami` -> "a curious visitor"
  - `sudo rm -rf /` -> "nice try. chomik has been alerted."
  - `help` -> lists available fake commands
  - `cat README` -> shows a short blurb about the site
  - `exit` or `Esc` -> closes the overlay
  - Anything else -> "command not found: <input>. try 'help'"
- History with up/down arrow keys
- Closes on `Esc` or clicking outside

**Implementation:**
- `src/app/components/TerminalOverlay.tsx` -- client component
- Mounted in the root layout, listens for `/` keydown (but not when an input is focused)
- Uses `useRouter()` for commands that navigate
- Store open/closed state in a context or simple useState in layout
- Theme-aware: cyberpunk gets green phosphor glow, luxury gets amber, paper gets typewriter feel

---

## #25, Fix /animals GIF content (quick)

**Labels:** `bug`, `content`

**Body:**

The Giphy URLs on `/animals` all return HTTP 200 but the GIF IDs were never verified to match their titles. "Happy Guinea Pig Munching Lettuce" probably shows something random. Fix:

1. Go to giphy.com, search for real guinea pig / hamster / bunny eating GIFs
2. Replace the 5 URLs with verified, correct ones
3. Or better: self-host 5-8 short `.webm` clips in `public/animals/` for reliability (no Giphy dependency, no hotlink breakage)
4. Consider adding more variety (10-15 clips) and a "favorites" localStorage feature

---

## #26, Comprehensive Simulator Upgrades

**Labels:** `feature`, `3d`

**Body:**

The `/experience` 3D scene is polished but could go deeper. Ideas for a "v2" pass:

**Scene presets:**
- Named presets on MainMenu: "Aurora" (greens/purples, slow drift), "Minimal" (white, few stars, no bloom), "Chaos" (max particles, fast rotation, strobing), "Deep Space" (dark blue, dense stars, no model)
- Save/load custom presets to localStorage
- Share presets via URL params (`/experience?preset=aurora`)

**New elements:**
- Audio-reactive mode: connects to mic or plays a built-in ambient track, particles pulse to frequency
- Environment options: nebula backdrop, grid floor, fog
- More models: allow switching between spectre.glb and 2-3 other models (geometric shapes, user's own upload via drag-and-drop)
- Particle behaviors: flocking, orbiting, exploding on click, trailing the cursor in 3D

**Controls polish:**
- Keyboard shortcuts (R = randomize, Space = pause rotation, 1-4 = presets)
- Screenshot button (exports canvas to PNG)
- Fullscreen toggle
- FPS counter (toggleable)

**Performance:**
- Auto-detect GPU tier and default to appropriate preset
- Progressive enhancement: start minimal, add bloom/particles as frame budget allows

---

## #27, GitHub Profile Page (wchen17.github.io)

**Labels:** `new-project`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

A personal GitHub Pages site at `wchen17.github.io` that serves as a landing/portfolio page. Could be:

1. **Minimal redirect** -- just points to mythcorp.org with a cool loading animation
2. **Standalone portfolio** -- separate from mythcorp, more professional/resume-oriented
3. **Project showcase** -- cards linking to repos (mythcorp, chomik, papers, etc.) with live previews

**If standalone:**
- Static HTML/CSS or a tiny Astro/Vite build
- Dark theme, terminal-inspired aesthetic
- Sections: intro, projects (with screenshots/demos), papers, contact
- GitHub contribution graph pulled via API
- Links to mythcorp.org for the full experience

**Repo:** `wchen17/wchen17.github.io` (or `wchen17/wchen17` for the profile README that shows on your GitHub profile page)

---

## #28, Site-wide Command Palette (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K)

**Labels:** `feature`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

In addition to (or instead of) the `/` terminal, a modern command palette like VS Code / Linear / Raycast:

- `Cmd+K` or `Ctrl+K` opens a search modal
- Fuzzy-matches all routes, actions, and theme options
- Items: "Go to /fmhy", "Go to /experience", "Switch to cyberpunk theme", "Open terminal", "Randomize simulation"
- Recent items shown by default
- Keyboard navigable (arrow keys + Enter)

Lighter than the terminal overlay, more "productivity tool" than "easter egg."

---

## #29, Per-route OG images via next/og on Workers

**Labels:** `feature`, `infra`, `seo`

**Body:**

No route has a real OpenGraph card. Sharing `/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime` on Slack/Twitter gets a blank rectangle. Add `src/app/<route>/opengraph-image.tsx` (Next 15 file convention) using `ImageResponse` from `next/og`. Verify it builds on Cloudflare Workers (some `@vercel/og` paths need `edge` runtime; the OpenNext shim should handle it but confirm).

Priorities:
1. `/` and `/wc` (site-level cards)
2. `/wc/papers/[slug]` (per-paper, pulls title + eyebrow)
3. `/fmhy/[category]` (per-category, pulls count + name)
4. `/wc/learn/[slug]` (per-walkthrough)

Use Cinzel for headings if it loads on the edge; otherwise fall back to system serif. Test with the Open Graph debugger.

---

## #30, sitemap.xml and robots.txt

**Labels:** `seo`, `infra`

**Body:**

Neither file exists. The FMHY mirror in particular is invisible to search because nothing tells Google the 22 category routes exist. Add:

- `src/app/sitemap.ts` enumerating all static routes plus the 22 FMHY categories, plus `/wc/papers/*` and `/wc/learn/*` entries.
- `src/app/robots.ts` allowing all, pointing to the sitemap.

Both are first-class Next 15 app-router conventions, no extra deps.

---

## #31, Cloudflare Web Analytics

**Labels:** `infra`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

The site has zero analytics. Cloudflare Web Analytics is free, cookieless, GDPR-friendly, and ships as a single beacon script. Add the snippet via `<Script strategy="afterInteractive">` in `layout.tsx`. Gate it behind `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` so dev doesn't pollute numbers.

Goal: find out which `/og/*` sketches and walkthroughs actually get traffic, so polish effort can follow attention.

---

## #32, Themed error.tsx + global error boundary

**Labels:** `feature`, `polish`, `reliability`

**Body:**

R3F can crash on mid-tier GPUs (shader compile, out-of-memory, lost context). Right now that bubbles to Next's default white error screen, breaking immersion. Add:

- `src/app/error.tsx` with `<SiteHeader />`, theme tokens, a warm message, and a "reload" button.
- `src/app/global-error.tsx` for the layout-level fallback.
- Optional: a "tell me what broke" mailto/link that prefills the error stack.

Pattern after `not-found.tsx` for tone.

---

## #33, Security headers via _headers

**Labels:** `infra`, `security`

**Body:**

Workers currently serves no CSP, no HSTS, no `X-Content-Type-Options`. Add a `public/_headers` file (Cloudflare Pages/Workers reads it) with:

- `Content-Security-Policy` permissive enough for R3F (`'unsafe-eval'` for some drei paths, sigh), inline styles allowed for Tailwind JIT.
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` denying camera/mic/geolocation.

Validate with securityheaders.com after deploy.

---

## #34, Cite-this buttons on papers

**Labels:** `paper`, `feature`

**Body:**

`/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime` has no citation export. Add a small `<CiteBox />` component at the bottom of each paper with copy buttons for BibTeX, APA, and a plain URL. Store the citation metadata next to the paper entry in `PAPERS` (author, year, title, venue if any).

Component lives at `src/app/wc/papers/_components/CiteBox.tsx` so future papers reuse it.

---

## #35, Playwright smoke test for theme bootstrap

**Labels:** `infra`, `testing`

**Body:**

The pre-paint theme bootstrap script in `layout.tsx` is load-bearing: if it breaks, the site flashes the wrong theme on every navigation. It currently has zero tests.

Add a minimal Playwright setup with one test that:
1. Sets `localStorage.mythcorp-theme = 'paper'` before page load.
2. Loads `/`.
3. Asserts `document.documentElement.dataset.theme === 'paper'` before any JS-hydrated component renders.
4. Asserts background color matches the paper token at first paint (no cyberpunk flash).

Repeat for `luxury` and `cyberpunk`. Run in CI via `npm run check:e2e`. Don't over-build the harness, one file in `tests/theme-bootstrap.spec.ts` is enough.

---

## #36, /wc/now page

**Labels:** `content`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

A sive.rs-style now-page: what is the author actively working on this month? Three or four bullets, dated. Updated monthly (or when it stops being true). Lives at `src/app/wc/now/page.tsx`.

Cheaper to build than `/wc/about` (#2) because there's no bio to write, just current state. Link from `/wc` index card.

Bonus: a `<NowBadge />` on `/wc` that shows the date stamp from the now-page, so visitors can see how stale it is.

---

## #37, Reading-time + last-updated stamps

**Labels:** `polish`, `content`

**Body:**

Papers and walkthroughs have no "X min read" or "updated YYYY-MM-DD" indicator. Both are tiny trust signals. Add:

- A `meta` field on each paper/walkthrough entry: `{ updated: '2026-05-06', readingMinutes: 12 }`.
- A small `<ArticleMeta />` component rendered under the heading.
- For reading time, just count words in the rendered content at build time (or hand-estimate, it's a handful of pages).

When MDX lands (#7), this becomes automatic via remark plugins.

---

## #38, Print stylesheet for papers

**Labels:** `polish`, `paper`

**Body:**

`/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime` is dense and people will want to PDF it. Right now `window.print()` gives a dark cyberpunk-themed mess. Add a `@media print` block in `globals.css` that:

- Forces white background, black text, no glow shadows.
- Hides `<SiteHeader />`, `<HelpDot />`, footer.
- Page-breaks before each `<Section>` heading.
- Strips bloom/glow from `themed-heading`.
- Shows full URLs after links: `a[href]::after { content: " (" attr(href) ")"; }`.

One block, scoped to `/wc/papers/*` via a body class added in that route's layout.

---

## #39, Interactive code blocks via Sandpack

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `feature`, `teaching`

**Body:**

The `<Code>` helper in walkthroughs is static. The big differentiator for `/wc/learn` would be editable code that runs live. Wire CodeSandbox's Sandpack (`@codesandbox/sandpack-react`) so any `<Code interactive>` block becomes an editor + preview pane.

Use cases:
- Theme-system walkthrough: edit token values, see the surface react.
- 3D-scene walkthrough (#4): tweak `STARS_PER_UNIT`, see the particle field rebuild.
- A future "intro to R3F" concept page: edit a small scene live.

Sandpack ships its own bundler, so it works on Cloudflare Workers. Lazy-load it so walkthroughs without interactive blocks don't pay the bundle cost.

---

## #40, /wc/learn/concepts track

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `content`

**Body:**

Walkthroughs explain *this file in this repo*. Concepts explain *the idea* independent of the repo. Add a parallel track at `src/app/wc/learn/concepts/<slug>/page.tsx` for short (5-10 min) explainers:

- `r3f-mental-model`: scene graph vs imperative three.js
- `ssg-vs-edge`: when to render where, with mythcorp examples
- `theme-tokens-vs-css-vars`: why tokens beat utility colors at scale
- `useGLTF-preload-order`: the StrictMode footgun and how to avoid it

Render both tracks on `/wc/learn` with a tab or filter. Different shape (shorter, more abstract) but reuses the `Walkthrough`/`Section`/`Code`/`Aside` primitives.

---

## #41, Diff-driven walkthrough format

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `feature`

**Body:**

Some refactors are best taught as before/after. `NewLandingPage.tsx` going from a 333-line monolith to 5 files under `src/app/components/landing/` is the canonical example.

Build a `<DiffSlider before={...} after={...} />` helper in `_components/` that:
- Shows the before file in one pane, after in another.
- A slider on top scrubs between them with a wipe or crossfade.
- Optional `<DiffNote at={lineNumber}>...</DiffNote>` children pin commentary to specific lines.

First use: `/wc/learn/landing-refactor`. Pulls double-duty as portfolio (here is how I think about file splits).

---

## #42, Mini 3D demos embedded in walkthroughs

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `3d`

**Body:**

`/wc/learn/3d-scene` (BACKLOG #4) would be all prose if built today. The teaching value triples if each Section has a tiny self-contained Canvas demonstrating one concept:

- `<MiniParticles />`: just the BufferGeometry + vertex colors, 500 points, no bloom.
- `<MiniBloom />`: one glowing cube, with a slider for `luminanceThreshold`.
- `<MiniStarsClamp />`: a count slider that visualizes what 1k vs 12k vs 25k particles does to FPS.

Each is a `<Canvas style={{ height: 240 }}>` inside a walkthrough Section. Lazy-load via `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` so the walkthrough index page isn't dragging R3F.

---

## #43, Walkthrough prereq DAG on /wc/learn

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `polish`

**Body:**

Add a `prereqs: string[]` field to each entry in the `WALKTHROUGHS` array. Render a small DAG (or just an indented list grouped by depth) on `/wc/learn` so readers know what to read first.

Bonus: a "next up" link at the bottom of each walkthrough that recommends a downstream node from the graph. Pairs with #40 concepts so the graph spans both tracks.

## #44, Show-the-bug walkthrough pattern

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `content`

**Body:**

A walkthrough format that opens with the broken behavior live on the page, then walks through diagnosing and fixing it. Higher engagement than starting from the solution.

Canonical first instance: the R3F double-Canvas StrictMode crash that drove the AppLoader's mutually-exclusive mounting (mentioned in BACKLOG #3). Title: `/wc/learn/the-strictmode-canvas-crash`.

Pattern:
1. Section 1: a deliberately-broken `<BugDemo />` that, on a click, mounts a second Canvas and crashes inside an error boundary. Visitor sees the crash live.
2. Section 2: stack trace explained.
3. Section 3: the fix (mutually-exclusive mounting), with the working `<FixedDemo />`.

## #45, Pagefind static search across FMHY + papers

**Labels:** `feature`, `performance`, `fmhy`

**Body:**

Listed as a low-priority bullet in #22, promote to its own item. Pagefind builds a static search index after `next build`, ships as a self-contained `pagefind/` directory, and runs entirely in the browser. No backend, works on Cloudflare Workers' static asset serving.

Setup:
1. `npm install -D pagefind`
2. Add `pagefind --site .vercel/output/static --output-path .vercel/output/static/pagefind` (or wherever OpenNext puts the static assets) to the build step.
3. Import the Pagefind UI in a new `<SiteSearch />` component, mount it in `SiteHeader` behind the existing search affordance.
4. Mark FMHY entries and paper sections with `data-pagefind-body` so the index excludes nav chrome.

Biggest win for the FMHY mirror: currently you can filter by category, but cannot search across all 22 categories at once.

## #46, Shiki + twoslash for typed code blocks

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `polish`

**Body:**

`/wc/learn` ships static text in `<Code>` blocks. For a site whose pitch is "codebase as learning artefact," code blocks should hover TypeScript types like the playground does.

Use `shiki` with the `twoslash` transformer (`@shikijs/twoslash`). Walkthrough code blocks tagged with the `ts twoslash` language get full type info inline: hover any identifier to see its inferred type, see compile errors on `@errors:` lines.

Compatible with the planned MDX wiring (#7), so do this after #7 lands. Until then, ship a non-twoslash `shiki` upgrade to get prettier syntax highlighting for free.

---

## #47, tldraw scratchpad sketch

**Labels:** `feature`, `og`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

Add `/og/scratchpad` with an embedded tldraw canvas. The whole point of `/og/` is "rough ideas kept on purpose," and a shared whiteboard is the literal embodiment.

Two modes:
1. **Local-only**: state in localStorage, each visitor has their own scratch.
2. **Multiplayer**: tldraw's sync server (or a Cloudflare Durable Object hosting the room). Anyone visiting the page joins the same canvas.

Start with local-only. If it's fun, promote to multiplayer behind a "join room" button.

---

## #48, Live visitor cursors on the landing page

**Labels:** `feature`, `nice-to-have`, `multiplayer`

**Body:**

A Cloudflare Durable Object hosting one "room" that tracks `{ id, x, y, color }` for each connected visitor. Renders other visitors' cursors as small floating glyphs on the landing page. Low traffic so basically free.

Reuse the DO connection for #18 (chat) and #47 (multiplayer tldraw) so the realtime layer is built once.

Toggle off in `prefers-reduced-motion` and on the experience page (cursors fighting Canvas events is bad).

---

## #49, react-three/rapier physics on the simulation

**Labels:** `3d`, `feature`

**Body:**

Drop in `@react-three/rapier` and enable physics for the spectre model and an optional "throw cube at it" mode in `/experience`. Unlocks the "explode on click" idea from #26.

Mode toggle on the MainMenu: "Physics: on/off". When on:
- Spectre model becomes a `<RigidBody>`.
- Clicking the canvas spawns a small cube with a velocity vector aimed at the spectre.
- Cubes despawn after 10s or 50-count, whichever first.

Rapier is WASM, so verify it loads under the OpenNext edge runtime before merging.

---

## #50, Partytown for third-party scripts

**Labels:** `performance`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

If/when #31 (analytics) lands, also bring in `@builder.io/partytown` so the analytics beacon runs off-main-thread. The R3F frame budget is tight on mid-tier GPUs, and any blocking third-party JS shows up as jank.

Only worth doing once there is actually a third-party script to host. Until then, parked.

---

## #51, Workers AI summarize-paper button

**Labels:** `feature`, `paper`, `infra`

**Body:**

Bind `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` (or whatever the current cheap Workers AI model is) and add a "summarize" button to each paper page. Click sends the rendered paper text to a Worker route, streams back a 3-bullet summary.

Why: demonstrates the Cloudflare stack end-to-end without leaving it. Also a useful affordance for the cybercrime paper, which is long.

Cache responses keyed by paper slug + content hash so repeated clicks are free.

---

## #52, Zod schema for FMHY parsed data

**Labels:** `fmhy`, `infra`, `reliability`

**Body:**

`scripts/fetch-fmhy.ts` hand-rolls regex to parse upstream markdown. When upstream changes shape (which they have, several times), the script silently produces garbage JSON and the bad data ships to the per-category routes.

Add `zod` schemas for the parsed structure (`Category`, `Section`, `Entry`, `ResourceLink`) and `.parse()` the script's output before writing files. Schema failure becomes a hard build error pointing at the exact category that broke.

Bonus: derive the TypeScript types in `_data/categories.ts` from the zod schema instead of hand-maintaining a parallel type.

---

## #53, Footnote helper for walkthroughs

**Labels:** `walkthrough`, `polish`

**Body:**

Walkthroughs reference other parts of the codebase and external links inline. Adding a footnote helper (`<Note id="1">...</Note>` in text, `<Footnotes>...</Footnotes>` at the bottom) would tighten the prose and let dense paragraphs stay readable.

Implement as two small helpers in `src/app/wc/learn/_components/Walkthrough.tsx`. Footnotes render as a numbered list at the page bottom, refs become clickable superscripts that scroll-jump.

---

## #54, Reading log at /wc/reads

**Labels:** `content`, `nice-to-have`

**Body:**

Promoted from #22's sticky-note list. A `/wc/reads` page listing books and papers the author has been through, each with a one-line take. Group by year. Pattern after `/wc/papers` shape: a `READS` array, simple card list.

Worth doing because it doubles as portfolio (taste signal) and as a low-stakes content treadmill for keeping the site alive between bigger pieces.

---

## #67, Giphy attribution + per-GIF source link on /animals

**Labels:** `content`, `legal`, `polish`

**Body:**

Giphy's developer terms require attribution: a visible "Powered by GIPHY" mark plus a link back to each GIF's source page. `/animals` currently shows only a generic "GIFs courtesy of GIPHY" line with no per-clip link. Store each clip's `giphy.com/gifs/<id>` URL alongside its entry, render a "view on GIPHY" link per clip, and add the attribution mark. The cleanest long-term fix is #68 (self-host), which removes the requirement entirely.

---

## #68, Self-host /animals clips (kill the hotlink dependency)

**Labels:** `content`, `reliability`, `performance`

**Body:**

`/animals` hotlinks `media.giphy.com` GIFs. Giphy can rotate IDs, rate-limit hotlinks, or pull media, at which point the page silently degrades to the "clip wandered off" fallback. Promote #25's option 3: download 5-8 short, verified clips into `public/animals/` as `.webm` (plus an `.mp4` fallback) and serve them with `<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>`. Removes the external dependency, the attribution requirement (#67), and the third-party bandwidth reliance. Bonus: webm is far smaller than the equivalent gif.

---

## #69, One device-capability gate (reduced-motion + GPU tier)

**Labels:** `infra`, `performance`, `accessibility`

**Body:**

Several items independently need to answer the same question: "should we run the heavy / animated thing?" (#10 3D mobile fallback, #11 reduced-motion a11y, #56 fluid, #57 raymarch, #63 audio-reactive). Build one `useDeviceCapability()` hook returning `{ reduceMotion, gpuTier, lowPower }` from `prefers-reduced-motion`, `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`, and an optional saved override, so every heavy feature consults a single source of truth instead of re-sniffing the environment in five places.

---

## #70, CI: guard the build on every PR

**Labels:** `infra`, `testing`

**Body:**

`npm run check` is the green-gate before commit, but nothing enforces it on pull requests. Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `npm ci && npm run check` on `pull_request`. Also guard against a stray `bun.lock` reappearing (the repo standardized on npm; `bun.lock` was removed). One job, `ubuntu-latest`, node 20, npm cache. Pairs with #21 (Cloudflare preview deploys) and #35 (Playwright smoke test) to round out the testing story.

---

## #71, /animals favorites via localStorage

**Labels:** `content`, `nice-to-have`, `fun`

**Body:**

Promote #25's tail. Let a visitor heart a clip; hearted clips sort to the front of the gallery and persist in `localStorage` under `mythcorp-animals-faves`. Tiny, warm, and gives the page a reason to revisit. Builds directly on the existing gallery thumbnail row.

---

# IDEABOARD, wow-tier web experiences

Not tidy issues, north stars. The bar for this section: a visitor should look at it and wonder *how was this made*. Everything below is buildable on the stack already installed (`@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `@react-three/postprocessing`, `three`, `gsap`), so these are ambitious but not fantasy. Pick one as a flagship, not all of them. References name real creators/sites worth studying; search them, do not assume exact URLs.

---

## #55, Drivable 3D portfolio (steer a car between routes)

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `3d`, `feature`

**Body:**

The Bruno Simon classic: land in a low-poly 3D world and *drive a little car* around it. Each building, billboard, or arch is a route (`/experience`, `/wc/papers`, `/fmhy`). Driving into one navigates. The "how is this a website" reaction is the whole point.

How, on this stack: R3F scene + `@react-three/rapier` (already scoped in #49) for the car's vehicle controller and ground collision. WASD / touch joystick input. Honk = easter egg. Reuse the Chicago theme: the world is a stylized mini-Chicago block. Lazy-load behind a "enter the world" button so the normal site still loads fast.

Reference: Bruno Simon's personal site, the Three.js Journey "physics" lessons. Scope: large. This is a flagship, plan it as its own multi-session arc.

---

## #56, WebGL fluid cursor backdrop

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `shaders`

**Body:**

A real-time fluid simulation (Navier-Stokes) running behind the landing hero. The cursor smears luminous dye through it; it never repeats. People genuinely cannot tell if it is video or live.

How: GLSL ping-pong framebuffers (advection, divergence, pressure-solve, curl). Pavel Dobryakov's open-source WebGL-Fluid-Simulation is the canonical reference implementation to learn from and adapt. Tint the dye with `--accent` / `--accent-glow` per theme. Gate behind `prefers-reduced-motion` and a GPU-tier check (ties to #10).

Scope: medium. One full-screen shader component, no new deps (raw WebGL or a `shaderMaterial` on a fullscreen R3F plane).

---

## #57, Raymarched shader hero (SDF, no geometry)

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `shaders`

**Body:**

A hero background that is *one fragment shader on one quad*, raymarching signed distance fields: soft shadows, ambient occlusion, a slowly morphing metaball forming the MYTHCORP "M". The wow is that there is no mesh, it is pure math per pixel.

How: a `shaderMaterial` (drei) on a fullscreen plane, time uniform driven by `useFrame`. Study Shadertoy and Inigo Quilez's SDF / raymarching articles (iquilezles.org). Keep the march step count modest and add a quality knob for mobile.

Scope: medium. High learning value, pairs perfectly with a `/wc/learn/concepts` entry (#40) explaining how it works.

---

## #58, GPGPU particle morph (wordmark to skyline to spectre)

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `3d`, `performance`

**Body:**

A million+ particles simulated entirely on the GPU that *morph* between shapes: the MYTHCORP wordmark, the Chicago skyline silhouette, and a point-cloud sampled from `spectre.glb`. GSAP scrubs the morph; particles flow like a murmuration between targets.

How: FBO / GPGPU technique. Positions and velocities live in floating-point textures, updated by a simulation shader, rendered as `THREE.Points`. drei has helpers; the three.js GPGPU examples are the reference. Sample target positions by reading mesh vertices / rasterizing the wordmark to a point set. This is the natural "v2" of the existing `ParticleField` in `Simulation.tsx`.

Scope: large. The single most "how??" item here for a graphics-literate audience.

---

## #59, Scrollytelling: the cybercrime paper as a pinned 3D narrative

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `paper`, `3d`

**Body:**

Apple-product-page energy applied to `/wc/papers/ai-cybercrime`. A pinned full-bleed canvas stays fixed while you scroll; scroll progress scrubs a camera path and drives the existing figures (BarrierToEntry toggles pre/post-AI, CapabilityRamp advances its year) as narrative beats. The page reads itself as you scroll.

How: GSAP ScrollTrigger (gsap is already installed) with `pin: true` and `scrub`. Tie `scrollProgress` to figure state and an R3F camera rig. Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` by falling back to the current static stacked layout.

Scope: medium-large. Turns the flagship paper into a showpiece and doubles as a `/wc/learn` subject.

---

## #60, Procedurally generated Chicago skyline

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `3d`, `generative`

**Body:**

Replace the static skyline image with a *seeded, procedurally generated* skyline: building heights, window-light patterns, and parallax depth derived from a seed, so it is subtly different each visit (or per-day, tied to #15 time-of-day theme). Fog, drifting clouds, a sun/moon that tracks local time.

How: instanced meshes (`<Instances>` from drei) for buildings, a seeded PRNG for layout, emissive window textures or a shader for lit windows. Layered parallax on scroll. This leans directly into the existing MYTHCORP / Chicago brand.

Scope: medium.

---

## #61, Desktop-OS mode for /wc (windowing portfolio)

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `feature`

**Body:**

Render `/wc` as a fake operating system: a boot sequence, a desktop with draggable/resizable windows, a taskbar, a clock, a "start" menu. Each window is a section (papers, learn, reads, about). The kind of site people screenshot and share.

How: a window manager in React (drag via pointer events, z-index stacking, minimize/maximize). No 3D required, so it is mostly state and CSS. henry.codes and the windows93 genre are the references for tone and interaction polish. Theme-aware chrome (cyberpunk = CRT, paper = skeuomorphic manila, luxury = frosted glass).

Scope: large, but cleanly incremental (ship one draggable window first).

---

## #62, WebGL displacement image gallery

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `shaders`, `content`

**Body:**

An image gallery (good fit for #54 `/wc/reads` covers or paper figures) where transitions are GLSL displacement effects: images warp, ripple, and melt into each other on hover and drag. The Codrops tutorials (tympanus.net/codrops) are the reference vein for this whole genre.

How: textures on R3F planes with a displacement/curl shader driven by hover progress and pointer velocity. `gsap` tweens the progress uniform. Lazy-load so non-gallery pages do not pay the cost.

Scope: medium.

---

## #63, Audio-reactive simulation

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `3d`, `audio`

**Body:**

Promote the audio-reactive bullet from #26 to a flagship. The `/experience` particle field pulses, blooms, and recolors to live audio: either the mic or a built-in ambient track. Bass drives scale, highs drive sparkle, beat detection triggers bursts.

How: Web Audio `AnalyserNode` FFT, sampled each frame in `useFrame`, mapped onto particle size / bloom `intensity` / color. Tasteful default (built-in track), mic as opt-in with a permission prompt. Pairs with the existing `<Bloom>` postprocessing.

Scope: medium.

---

## #64, Live ASCII / halftone post-process pass

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `shaders`, `3d`

**Body:**

A postprocessing effect that renders the entire 3D scene as live ASCII characters or halftone dots, recomputed every frame. Cheap to add, disproportionately "wait, how?".

How: a custom effect in the existing `@react-three/postprocessing` pipeline (an `Effect` subclass with a fragment shader that quantizes luminance into a glyph atlas / dot pattern). Could be a toggle on the `/experience` MainMenu next to the theme presets (#26).

Scope: small-medium. The best effort-to-wow ratio in this section.

---

## #65, Text scramble / decode effect

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `polish`, `easter-egg`

**Body:**

The cyberpunk "decode" animation: headings resolve from random glyph noise into the final text, character by character. Small, charming, very on-theme for the cyberpunk palette.

How: a tiny `useScramble` hook (no deps) that interpolates each character from a random charset to its target over a few hundred ms, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. Apply to `AnimatedHeading` and the SiteHeader wordmark on route change. Gate the heavier version to the cyberpunk theme.

Scope: small. Good warm-up before a bigger flagship.

---

## #66, Live GLSL playground walkthrough

**Labels:** `ideaboard`, `wow`, `walkthrough`, `teaching`

**Body:**

A `/wc/learn` page with an editable GLSL fragment shader and a live preview, so readers tweak the raymarched hero (#57) or fluid sim (#56) and watch it recompile in real time. The "codebase as a learning artefact" pitch, taken to its logical extreme.

How: a `<textarea>` (or CodeMirror) feeding a `shaderMaterial`, recompiling on change with error display. Lighter than the Sandpack idea (#39) because it only needs to compile a shader, not bundle JS. Pairs with #57 / #56 as their explainer pages.

Scope: medium.
