/**
 * Samples the holding screen's roll and asserts it stays inside its noise
 * budget. Run with `npm run check:roll`.
 *
 * This exists because a budget fails silently in both directions. Priced too
 * high and a combination nobody wants still appears; priced too low and an
 * effect is deleted by arithmetic rather than by a decision, which is what
 * happened to the rain on the first pass: it survived on two combinations out
 * of sixty and would simply never have been seen. Reading the weights does not
 * tell you either of those things. Counting the outcomes does.
