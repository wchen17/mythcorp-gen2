/**
 * Five ways to render one model, loaded one at a time. Four components, one of
 * them twice: `particle` holds the shape, `swarm` is the same cloud thinned
 * out and slowed down until it only suggests one.
 *
 * `ink` was cut on 2026-09-05 after it started drawing nothing at all. Not a
 * prop problem: it renders blank in `/wc/lab/canvas` too, under a completely
 * different prop set, in both schemes, at both viewport aspects, and on both
 * three 0.178 and 0.185, with the GLB fetching 200 and no error logged. It did
 * render earlier the same day, so it is intermittent rather than dead, and it
 * is the same silent failure this comment already blamed for killing the ink
 * treatment of the message and the `etch` variant. Three strikes for one
 * component. A one in five chance of an empty stage on the only page visitors
 * can see is worse than four styles that always work, so it is out of the
 * roster. `InkObject.tsx` stays vendored and stays in the lab, which is where
 * to debug it. Put the string back in HOLD_STYLES to restore it.
 *
 * Two more variants were built and cut. `matrix` (AsciiObject on a two
 * character ramp) never resolved into a figure at any exposure, and `etch`
 * (InkObject opened right up) drew nothing at all, the same silent failure
 * that killed the ink treatment of the message. Both are parameter sets on
 * components that already work here, which is worth remembering before
 * reaching for them again. Each vendored
 * component is a megabyte of WebGL and its own copy of the loader stack, so
 * they are dynamic imports: the holding screen ships none of them until a
 * style is picked, and switching fetches exactly that chunk. ssr:false because
 * every one of them reaches for a canvas on mount. The options object has to
 * be an inline literal: next/dynamic reads it at compile time, so hoisting it
 * to a shared const fails the build.

/**
 * Four, not the seven the registry offers. The dither and glass variants were
 * tried and cut: both quantize or refract whatever is behind the model, and
 * here that is transparency, so the spectre simply vanished. Giving them an
 * opaque backdrop is the only thing that fixes them, and it paints a
 * rectangle over the middle of the field, which is the one thing this screen
 * cannot afford. Retried with the lighting turned up and the dither inverted,
 * on the theory that the model just needed more light: it does not, the
 * inverted clear colour simply fills the canvas box and the spectre is still
 * not there.

 * top of the readout. A canvas inside a non-interactive parent never receives
 * a pointermove, so the cursor push those components are built around was
 * silently doing nothing: the cloud that is supposed to scatter under your
 * hand just floated. `pointer-events: auto` on a child of a `none` parent is
 * hit-tested again, which buys back the interaction without making the box
 * itself swallow anything.
 *
 * The ascii and ink renderers register no pointer listeners, so they stay
