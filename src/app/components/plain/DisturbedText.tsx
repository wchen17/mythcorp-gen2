 * behind the words shows through the holes.
 *
 * The ramp is deliberately the one `asciiRender` quantizes dye with, not the
 * scramble charset in `useScramble`. Those two effects say different things:
 * the scramble is a word arriving, and this is a word being disturbed by the
 * same fluid that is drawing the message behind it. Sharing the ramp is what
 * makes the second reading available at all.
 *
 * Index 0 of the ramp is a space, which is what makes the hottest cells punch
 * an actual hole rather than merely swapping one glyph for another.

 * type reads as disturbed and the small type reads as broken. Scaling with the
