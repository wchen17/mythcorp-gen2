 * The message, if there is one, is drawn as its own pass on top. It used to be
 * dye like everything else, which read beautifully in a still frame and fell
 * apart in motion: a letter body carries a range of dye values, so the ramp
 * painted `.`, `-`, `=` and `@` inside one stroke and the shape never
 * resolved. Two levels, body and edge, is what makes it a letter rather than
 * a texture. The fluid still carries a soft echo of the words underneath.
