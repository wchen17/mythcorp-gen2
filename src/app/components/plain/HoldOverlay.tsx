/**
 * Frost was built here and cut, which is worth writing down because it is the
 * third time this exact trap has been walked into. It answers the cursor
 * harder than anything else in the library, 77 references to the pointer, and
 * hovering melts a hole through the ice that refreezes behind you. But it
 * refracts what is BEHIND it, and behind it here is transparency, so with
 * nothing to bend it renders as a murky dark blob sitting on top of the
 * spectre. Same failure as the dither and glass models in HoldStage. The rule
 * this keeps teaching: on this screen, only components that draw their own
 * geometry survive. Anything that samples or refracts its backdrop has no
 * backdrop to work with.
 *
 * All of these bind pointer listeners inside their own subtree, so the
 * `pointer-events-none` layer below was disabling the half of each effect that
 * responds to you: the rain's `stir`, and, more embarrassingly, the shield's
 * `gridReveal="hover"`, which means the lattice only lights where the cursor
 * crosses it. That one was not a missing flourish, it was the entire mechanic.
 *
 * Re-enabling hit testing here is safe because the layer sits at `-z-10`.
 * Anything painted above it, which is every picker and every link, is hit
 * first, and the overlay only picks up pointers over otherwise empty screen.
